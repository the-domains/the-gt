Day 1

This is the first post on my journey to recognising my trading which is in fact a gambling habit, my learning and redemption as I look to put my life back together and the process I will look to take. I will be sharing my thoughts, my learnings and everything in between.

Psychology Profile

Not taxing mentally - but at times my pre-existing gold positions (large) put considerable strain as they moved to the bearish side. Positioning was obviously too large for my capital and stops were placed at points where my entire capital would be wiped out. The gold position appears to be blind hope that I could recover the losses which came about by 1) adding to the position as it was losing 2) stretching the stop losses
